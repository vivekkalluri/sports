            Saturday in London, Jamaican Usain Bolt will run a final 100 meters at track and field's World Championships at approximately 4:45 p.m. ET. A week later, after a relay finale, he says he'll retire. Bolt will leave with an eye-popping highlight reel that includes eight Olympic gold medals over the past three summer games.

Initially, there were nine golds — the hallowed Triple Triple — he won the 100 meters, 200 meters and 4 X 100 relay in three straight Olympic games — 2008, 2012 and 2016. But earlier this year, Bolt lost one of the medals when a teammate on the 2008 Jamaican relay team tested positive for a banned drug after his urine sample was re-analyzed by the International Olympic Committee in 2016.

Nine or eight, I was lucky enough to see all the races.

Jesse Owens was history's most important sprinter. ... Carl Lewis made it profitable to be a sprinter. ... But Usain Bolt is the greatest sprinter of all time.

Ato Boldon, Four-Time Olympic Medalist, Track & Field Analyst, NBC

"Here I am"

And I remember something he said after winning the last one. It was a year ago, in Rio de Janiero, Brazil. At his press conference, someone asked Bolt about growing up in a rural part of Jamaica, playing sports like cricket and soccer. And running. Did he start with big dreams?

Not really.

"I just started out in athletics and I was really good and I just continued," Bolt said. "Over the years, I started making goals because I started getting better and I just continued running and pushing myself and working hard until ... here I am."

Here. I. Am.

Usain Bolt has announced his presence to the world so many times over the past nine years. But no hello was as big or gob-smacking as the first one. August 2008, in China. I remember the hazy Beijing night at the Bird's Nest Stadium. The quiet before the gun — that moment of exquisite tension in any 100-meter race. But especially now. Bolt was the sport's new phenom; the lanky 6-foot-5-inch Jamaican giant among much smaller and more compact sprinters, had people buzzing about his potential.
