            Briton Tony Bellew suggested undisputed cruiserweight world champion Oleksandr Usyk could be his final opponent because "I'm a danger to myself".

The 35-year-old faces Ukraine's Usyk, who has won all 15 of his professional fights, at the Manchester Arena on 10 November.

"The sooner I stop, maybe the better because I'll fight anyone - King Kong, if I was allowed I would," Bellew said.

I am a risk, emotionally and physically, I am just a risk. I'm dangerous, I'm a danger to myself

"I've had an exit strategy planned for quite a while now," he told BBC Sport.

"If I don't stop now, my wife will divorce me after four or five months and that's not the plan," he added.

"I am a risk, emotionally and physically, I am just a risk. I'm dangerous, I'm a danger to myself."

Bellew had earlier told a news conference: "Babe, if you're watching this, I promise you this will maybe be my last one."
