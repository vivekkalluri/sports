            <p>Stokes, 27, was found not guilty in August after an incident outside a Bristol nightclub in September 2017.
Stokes missed the second Test against India because of his trial but returned for the rest of the series."You know when someone comes back and they lose a little bit of their aura?" Flintoff said referring to Stokes."To me, there's a bit of an unsureness about him," he told the BBC podcast, </p>

        <p>The former Australia batsman has agreed a four-year deal and will lead the Division Two side in all formats.The 49-year-old's appointment means Twenty20 coach Daniel Vettori will leave after two seasons with the club."It's a privilege to be asked to coach Middlesex and to accept one of the plum jobs in world cricket," Law said.He will leave his job with West Indies after their tours of India and Bangladesh."I have very much enjoyed my time with the West Indies and wish the staff and players every success," Law added."There is never a good time to leave but the opportunity to work with Middlesex for four years at the home of cricket was too good to decline."Law played one Test for Australia, but featured in 54 one-day internationals and led Queensland to five Sheffield Shield and two one-day titles as captain.</p>

                <p>Moeen elected not to progress the matter any further at the time and we have not been able to ascertain any new additional evidence through our enquiries."As such, the matter is considered closed."We take a zero-tolerance approach to remarks of this nature, they have no place in our sport, or in society, and any allegations raised with us are treated seriously and respectfully."Moeen, 31, said the comment was made in the first Test of the 2015 series, which England won 3-2 to regain the Ashes.In an extract of his book published in the Times, Moeen said: "An Australian player had turned to me on the field and said, 'Take that, Osama'. I could not believe what I had heard."I remember going really red. I have never been so angry on a cricket field."The alleged slur appears to be a reference to Islamist terrorist Osama Bin Laden. Moeen, who was born in Birmingham, is a Muslim of Pakistani and English heritage.Moeen said he told "a couple" of team-mates about the incident and believed England coach Trevor Bayliss raised it with then Australia counterpart Darren Lehmann.<p>

                    <p>Still not clear what career path Rashid will take'All-rounder Rashid played in Yorkshire's County Championship-winning teams of 2014 and 2015, and director of cricket Martyn Moxon was pleased to have "a very valuable cricketer" signed up for the 2019 season - although the situation beyond that is still unclear.Moxon continued: "For now, it will just be for a year because it's still not clear what career path he's going to take. He's back in the Test team and continues to do well, so we'll see where that takes us."Obviously going into 2020 and with the new 100-ball competition, players are waiting to see how that will affect contracts."I think for now it's good to have the one year and see how the winter goes for Adil. We'll probably have another look at it after the World Cup [in England and Wales next summer] and see where he is, particularly with England and how much he's involved with them.            "In the short term, it's good to know when he's available he'll be playing for us."</p>
